# vim-config
My NeoVim configuration

To make everything work you will need to install two things:

### Packer

git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
 
### Ripgrep

- brew install rg

### Lazygit

- brew install lazygit


### Notes

- this is based on https://github.com/thiagoramos23/vim-config
- and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE&ab_channel=ThePrimeagen


### Up and running

- Clone this repo
- git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
- Open neovim and execute ":PackerSync"

You should be ready to go :)
